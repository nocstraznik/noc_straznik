            <h1>Hexadecimal to ASCII</h1>
                <h2>The Martian</h2>
                    <p>In the book <em>"The Martian" by Andy Weir</em>, astronaut Mark Watney macgyvers an abandoned rover to communicate with NASA. Making the most of his limited resources, he rigs the rover's camera to be able to point to different signs to use hexadecimal to convey more while using less information.</p>
                <h2>What is Hexadecimal?</h2>
                    <p>As decimal uses base ten, hexadecimal uses base sixteen. It is rendered using digits 0 through 9, and letters A through F. One common use of hexadecimal is to identify specific colors in computer graphics (#FFFFFF, #000000) using six characters. Each pair of characters corresponds to a color; red, green, and blue respectively. Here, we'll focus on the hexadecimal codes that have decimal equivalents paired with ASCII characters that Mark Watney used to communicate with NASA.</p>
